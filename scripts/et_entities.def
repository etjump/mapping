"gridsize" granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map2. Values of three intergers by spaces, represents number of units between grid points in X, Y and Z. Default gridsize is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.
"fogclip" Determines how far world is drawn. Note that this is not actual game units, but rather calculates distance between PVS clusters, therefore _blocksize will affect this key.

/*QUAKED dlight (0 1 0) (-12 -12 -12) (12 12 12) - STARTOFF ONETIME
-------- KEYS --------
"style" value is an int from 1-19 that contains a pre-defined 'flicker' string.
"stylestring" set your own 'flicker' string.  (ex. "klmnmlk"). NOTE: this should be all lowercase. If both "style" and "stylestring" are set, "style" is ignored.
"offset" change the initial index in a style string.  So val of 3 in the above example would start this light at 'N'.  (used to get dlights using the same style out of sync).
"atten" offset from the alpha values of the stylestring.  stylestring of "ddeeffzz" with an atten of -1 would result in "ccddeeyy"
"shader" name of shader to apply
"sound" sound to loop every cycle (this actually just plays the sound at the beginning of each cycle)
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
STARTOFF doesn't spawn in until triggered
ONETIME	when the dlight is triggered, it will play through it's cycle once, then shut down until triggered again.
-------- NOTES --------
Stylestring characters run at 10 cps in the game (meaning the alphabet, at 24 characters, would take 2.4 seconds to cycle).
Characters in stylestring represent the intensity of light: a = lowest and z = highest.
Use color picker to set color or key "color". Values are 0.0-1.0 for each color (R G B).
If using "sound", make sure you set the key to "sound" instead of "noise"! The sound button sets "noise" key instead of "sound".
The intensity of dlights cannot be scaled up or down, they have fixed intensity tied to the characters.

Pre-defined style strings:
1 - "mmnmmommommnonmmonqnmmo"
2 - "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"
3 - "mmmmmaaaaammmmmaaaaaabcdefgabcdefg"

LOOPED_OFF Starts off and loops when toggled
GLOBAL plays whether or not in players PVS. Same as NO_PVS.
ACTIVATOR plays only to the activator. Note that this results in no sound as it play to the targeting entity, not the player.
VIS_MULTIPLE plays also in the PVS cluster where the targeted misc_vis_dummy_multiple is.
NO_PVS plays whether or not in players PVS. Same as GLOBAL.
-------- NOTES --------
Global and activator sounds can't be combined with looping.
Multiple identical looping sounds will just increase volume without any speed cost.
Speaker radius is fixed, increasing/decreasing volume only scales the volume level within the radius.
Use in-game speaker editor if you want to control radius of a speaker.
